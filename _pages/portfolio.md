## [AI-Powered Flappy Bird Game Using NEAT Algorithm](https://github.com/Nexalyze/AI-Powered-Flappy-Bird-Game-Using-NEAT-Algorithm)

![Flappy](/images/flappy.png){: .align-left width="200px"}
The project involves game development with Pygame, creating classes for the bird, pipes, and base, and implementing utility functions for game mechanics. The NEAT algorithm evolves the AI by evaluating neural networks, optimizing them over 50 generations. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of NeuroEvolution and real-time AI applications, enhancing my skills in game development and AI integration. This experience is valuable for creating AI systems that can adapt and improve in dynamic environments.


 ## [NIFTY-50](https://github.com/Nexalyze/The-Nifty-50-Stock-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning)

![Nifty-50](/images/nifty50.png){: .align-left width="200px"}
Developed a machine learning model using Random Forest Regressor to predict the next day's opening price of Nifty 50 stocks, leveraging historical stock data for accurate predictions.

Collected and preprocessed data, engineered features, and fine-tuned the model to achieve high accuracy. Evaluated the model using MSE and RÂ² metrics, confirming its reliability in forecasting stock prices.

This project enhanced my understanding of financial data analysis and the practical application of machine learning in the stock market. It underscores the power of data-driven insights for making informed trading decisions.
