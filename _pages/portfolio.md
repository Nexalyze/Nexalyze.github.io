ðŸŽ® AI-Powered Flappy Bird Game Using NEAT Algorithm
In this project, I took on the challenge of blending game development with cutting-edge AI. Using Pygame, I created dynamic classes for the bird, pipes, and base while implementing utility functions that bring the game mechanics to life. The real magic happens with the NEAT algorithm, which evolves the AI by optimizing neural networks across 50 generations.

This project wasn't just about making a gameâ€”it was about pushing the boundaries of NeuroEvolution. I deepened my understanding of how AI can adapt and improve in real-time, a skill thatâ€™s invaluable in crafting systems that thrive in dynamic environments.

If you're curious about how AI can revolutionize game development, dive into the details of this project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/sourish-ml/AI-Powered-Flappy-Bird-Game-Using-NEAT-Algorithm).

Stock markets are unpredictable, but with the right tools, we can bring some order to the chaos. In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model using the Random Forest Regressor to predict the next day's opening prices for Nifty 50 stocks. By leveraging historical stock data, I engineered features and fine-tuned the model for maximum accuracy.

The model was evaluated using MSE and RÂ² metrics, proving its reliability in forecasting stock prices. This experience taught me the power of data-driven insights for making informed trading decisions, and the practical applications of ML in financial markets.

Curious about how this model works? Check out the code and methodology on my [GitHub](https://github.com/sourish-ml/The-Nifty-50-Stock-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning).
