Here's my [Resume](\files\Sourish_Chatterjee.pdf)
<hr>

With a solid foundation in Computer Science and Engineering, I am currently pursuing a B.Tech degree with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology (MSIT), Kolkata. My journey in this field has been marked by a deepening interest in AI and ML, driven by both academic challenges and personal curiosity.

My educational journey began at Ram Mohan Mission High School, where my passion for technology was first ignited. This early interest set the stage for my decision to pursue Higher Secondary Education at Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, specializing in Computer Science. This transition allowed me to further explore and solidify my understanding of programming and algorithms.

At MSIT, I've not only focused on mastering core subjects but have also embraced the opportunity to apply my knowledge through various projects. Some of the key projects I’ve worked on include the Real-Estate Price Prediction Model and AI-Powered Flappy Bird, which have significantly enhanced my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.

You can learn more about my [experience](/experience/) and [education](/education/) here, where I’ve detailed the projects and skills I’ve developed along the way.
