Here's my [Resume](\files\Sourish_Chatterjee.pdf)
<hr>

## Who is Sourish?

I‚Äôm Sourish Chatterjee, a tech enthusiast with a deep-seated love for AI and ML. My journey began at Ram Mohan Mission High School, where my curiosity for technology first took root, and it blossomed into a full-fledged passion at DPS Ruby Park as I delved into the world of Computer Science.

### Why AI & ML?

It all started with a spark‚Äîa fascination with how technology could unlock the mysteries of the universe, inspired by the genius of _Tony Stark_. Today, I channel that spark into crafting models that push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence, from predicting [stock markets](https://github.com/sourize/The-Nifty-50-Stock-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning) to [evolving game AI](https://github.com/sourize/AI-Powered-Flappy-Bird-Game-Using-NEAT-Algorithm).

## My Toolkit üîß

- AI/ML Wizardry: I bring ideas to life using neural networks, random forests, and other machine learning models. My languages of choice? Python and C.
- Data Whisperer: I transform raw data into actionable insights with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib, turning chaos into clarity.
- Team Player: Collaboration is key. Through internships, hackathons, and group projects, I‚Äôve learned that the best solutions often come from teamwork.

## My Adventures üöÄ

My journey has taken me through exciting projects like a [Real-Estate Price Prediction Model](https://github.com/sourize/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning), a [Stock Market Analysis Tool](https://github.com/sourize/The-Nifty-50-Stock-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning), and even an [AI-powered Flappy Bird Game using NeuroEvolution](https://github.com/sourize/AI-Powered-Flappy-Bird-Game-Using-NEAT-Algorithm). Each project has taught me to navigate the complex world of AI, balancing creativity with precision.
