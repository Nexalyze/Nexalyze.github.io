<h1 align=center; style='color:#5D8AA8;'>👋🏼 Hello there, I'm Sourish!</h1>

I’m an undergrad student pursuing CSE(AIML) at [MSIT](https://www.linkedin.com/school/meghnadsahainstituteoftechnology/).

I'm currently focused on my core subjects while developing a keen interest in Machine Learning 🧑🏼‍💻.

I've built several small projects to showcase my learning which you can explore in my [Github](https://github.com/sourize?tab=repositories).

I am embracing the concept of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), and I'm sharing my progress on [X/Twitter](https://X.com/sourize_).

This year, I'm excited to participate in [SIH-2024](/sih2024/), which means a new project and a fresh learning experience —stay tuned!

If you'd like to connect and chat about projects or anything else, feel free to [reach out](https://x.com/sourize).

Want to learn more about my [skills](/skills.md/), [education](/education.md/), and [experience](/experience.md/)?
