👋🏼 Hello there, I’m Sourish ! 
<br>

👨‍💻 I’m a 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at [Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/school/meghnadsahainstituteoftechnology/).

<br>
🔬 My research interests lie in deep learning, neural networks, and creating impactful ML models.

<br>

📚 I’m currently working on projects like predicting real-estate costs and exploring energy consumption patterns, with a strong focus on applying machine learning techniques.

<br>

🎓 I aspire to become an ML Engineer, developing models that help explore the unknowns of the universe and define the existence of life.

<br>

Let's connect if you're looking for a driven ML Engineer to innovate and make an impact together.
