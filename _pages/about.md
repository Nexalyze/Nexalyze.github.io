An undergrad at [MSIT](https://www.linkedin.com/school/meghnadsahainstituteoftechnology/) with a passion for **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. My fascination with technology started early, inspired by the magic of movies like _Iron Man_, and now I’m on a mission to turn that inspiration into innovation.
