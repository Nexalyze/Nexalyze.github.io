<h1 align=center>👋🏼 Hello there, I'm Sourish!</h1>
<hr>

<h3 style='color:#5D8AA8; text-align:center'>Welcome to my tech playground, where curiosity meets innovation.</h3>

I'm an undergrad at [MSIT](https://www.linkedin.com/school/meghnadsahainstituteoftechnology/) with a passion for **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. My fascination with technology started early, inspired by the magic of movies like _Iron Man_, and now I’m on a mission to turn that inspiration into innovation.

Along the way, I share my journey through **AIML** projects & experiments on [X/Twitter](https://X.com/sourize_), and [My Blog Posts](/year-archive/). From building predictive models to fun games, I’m always exploring new ideas, and any personal projects I start will be added here.
