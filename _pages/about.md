<h1 align=center>👋🏼 Hello there, I'm Sourish!</h1>

### Welcome to my tech sandbox, where curiosity meets innovation. 

I’m a tech explorer diving deep into **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, currently navigating my undergrad journey at [MSIT](https://www.linkedin.com/school/meghnadsahainstituteoftechnology/). My fascination with technology started early, inspired by the magic of movies like _Iron Man_, and now I’m on a mission to turn that inspiration into innovation.

### 🌟 What I’m Doing:

I am embracing the concept of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), sharing my journey through **AIML** projects and other things and some experiments on [X/Twitter](https://X.com/sourize_) & [My Blog Posts](/year-archive/). From building predictive models to creating fun games, or tackling hackathons like [SIH-2024](/posts/2024/09/SIH2024/), I’m always chasing the next challenge.
