<h1 align=center>👋🏼 Hello there, I'm Sourish!</h1>

🧑‍💻 I’m an undergrad student studying CSE(AIML) at [@MSIT](msit.edu.in).

Currently I am studying my college's core subjects along with a keen interset in Machie Learning 🧑🏼‍💻. 

I have built some projects to showcase my learning which you will find in my [github](github.com/sourize).

I am adapting the idea of [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) for which I am using [X/Twitter](X.com/sourize_).

This year I am also participating in SIH, so a new project and a new learning experience hehe!!

If you want to know more about me and talk about projects and stuffs let’s [Connect](x.com/sourize)
