<h1 align="center">👋🏼 Hello there, I'm Sourish!</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>An Aspiring ML Engineer</em>
</p>

---

I am an [MSIT](https://www.linkedin.com/school/meghnadsahainstituteoftechnology/) undergraduate with a strong interest in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. Inspired by the world of technology, I'm now working on the [SIH-2024 Hackathon](https://www.sih.gov.in/), sharing AI/ML ideas across several platforms and constantly honing my talents. My primary focus is on mastering my collegecoursework, contributing to open-source projects, and applying predictive models to real-world problems and creative applications.

I have a solid academic foundation, practical expertise with AI and ML projects, and thrive in collaborative contexts. I'm constantly willing to learn and contribute, both individually and together.
