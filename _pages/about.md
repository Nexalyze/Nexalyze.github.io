I am a dedicated Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist with a strong foundation in AI and ML. Passionate about developing innovative solutions, I strive to leverage data to uncover insights and drive impactful change.
<br>
<br>
As a 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student specializing in AI and ML at Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology, I bring hands-on experience in predictive modeling and data analysis. I've developed projects like real-estate cost prediction, stock market analysis, sentiment analysis for restaurant reviews, and an AI-powered Flappy Bird game.
<br>
<br>
My internships at Prodigy Infotech and the Academy of Skill Development have strengthened my skills in Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, as well as data visualization and teamwork. I aim to work for top tech companies like DRDO, Google, Microsoft, or Apple, developing ML models to explore the universe and understand life's complexities.
