## 🧠 Who is Sourish?

I'm a tech enthusiast with a deep passion for AI and ML. My journey began at Ram Mohan Mission High School, where my curiosity for technology first took root. It blossomed into a full-fledged passion at DPS Ruby Park as I delved into the world of Computer Science.

### 💡 Why AI & ML?

It all started with a spark—a fascination with how technology could unlock the mysteries of the universe, inspired by the genius of _Tony Stark_. Today, I channel that spark into:

- Crafting models that push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence
- Predicting [stock markets](https://github.com/sourize/The-Nifty-50-Stock-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning)
- [Evolving game AI](https://github.com/sourize/AI-Powered-Flappy-Bird-Game-Using-NEAT-Algorithm)
