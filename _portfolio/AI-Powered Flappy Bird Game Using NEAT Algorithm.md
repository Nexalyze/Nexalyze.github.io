The project creates an AI agent that learns to play **Flappy Bird** using the **NEAT algorithm**. By evolving neural networks, the AI improves its gameplay over 50 generations.

### Highlights:
- **Game**: Built using Pygame with bird, pipes, and background assets.
- **AI**: Uses neural networks to decide when the bird should jump, improving performance with each generation.

The AI agent successfully learns the game and gets better at it with each attempt.
