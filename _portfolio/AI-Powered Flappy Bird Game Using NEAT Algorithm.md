ðŸŽ® AI-Powered Flappy Bird Game Using NEAT Algorithm
In this project, I took on the challenge of blending game development with cutting-edge AI. Using Pygame, I created dynamic classes for the bird, pipes, and base while implementing utility functions that bring the game mechanics to life. The real magic happens with the NEAT algorithm, which evolves the AI by optimizing neural networks across 50 generations.

This project wasn't just about making a gameâ€”it was about pushing the boundaries of NeuroEvolution. I deepened my understanding of how AI can adapt and improve in real-time, a skill thatâ€™s invaluable in crafting systems that thrive in dynamic environments.
