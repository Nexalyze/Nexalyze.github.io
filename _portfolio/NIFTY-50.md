Stock markets are unpredictable, but with the right tools, we can bring some order to the chaos. In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model using the Random Forest Regressor to predict the next day's opening prices for Nifty 50 stocks. By leveraging historical stock data, I engineered features and fine-tuned the model for maximum accuracy.

The model was evaluated using MSE and RÂ² metrics, proving its reliability in forecasting stock prices. This experience taught me the power of data-driven insights for making informed trading decisions, and the practical applications of ML in financial markets.

Curious about how this model works? Check out the code and methodology on my [GitHub](https://github.com/sourish-ml/The-Nifty-50-Stock-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning).
